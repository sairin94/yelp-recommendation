So order before you get hungry.\n",

I may be a little biased having grown up around here, but I still regularly try all the Philly staples (Pat's, Jim's, Dalessandro's. . .) and they never compare to Pete's. People I bring there tend to agree, too. The meat is chopped up somewhat fine, there's a good balance of meat and cheese, and the rolls are lightly toasted. I think because they're such a small neighborhood pizza place they don't get the recognition they deserve. Granted, the place isn't much to look at and there's no seating, but it's totally worth for me to sit in my car and eat my steak right there. Every time I come in town I make a point of stopping in for a cheesesteak on the way to or from the airport (they're only a few minutes away), and I suggest you do the same. You won't be sorry.\n",

From the toasted Amoroso roll to the fresh hand cut lettuce and tomatoes carefully placed on the sandwich, the artistry that went into making the sandwich was only eclipsed by it's size and quality.  The only downside is that they have no seating.  I look forward to several return visits.\n",

You would be both horrified and impressed at the amount I ate. The cheesesteak, however.... Maybe I didn't know what I ordered. I was expecting a regular cheesesteak. What I got was a steak hoagie with topping you would put on a burger.  The meat and bread was good but the ketchup, mustard, pickle, mayo combo-not for me:(\n",

Both were very good cheesesteaks! \n",

      "Well worth the $28 taxi fare there and the 1+ hour walk back to the airport in the heat and humidity.  Airport security followed us then stopped us since we were so sweaty and had been obviously caught on cameras as we walked onto the airport property disregarding the no walking signs. They appeared to have a hard time believing our \"we'd never had a cheesesteak and just decided to walk back\" situation.  They probably marked us down as weird Californians, but the cheesesteaks were well worth it!  \n",

      "User27 has given 4.0 stars and said: It's been around for over 30 years so that tell you something. We like the cheesesteaks-chopped meat and a soft roll makes them really tasty. Not badly priced either. They have a special for $6 large plain pizza which is really more like a medium but who cares lol. Pizza is ok; thin and nothing really to write home about but so far we've had the cheesesteaks, fries, onion rings, broccoli bites, and the wings. All pretty standard fare-wings are of the smaller size but cooked well. They have a breakfast menu but we've never had. Ordered for delivery and food came fast. Tonight I ordered two cheesesteaks, fries, broccoli bites, wings and a wrap and it was ready for pickup in about 20 minutes. So, obviously they're fast lol. Young girls manning the register, and the three older Greek? men cooking. You walk in and it's like a regular corner type pizza joint lol. It's become our go to for food. Try it out. They have an extensive menu so there's something for everyone. Couple tips-$2.00 delivery charge and if you pick up food and use a card it's a $1.00 surcharge no matter the price, which I found odd but whatever. Worth a try!\n",

Although the delivery did take an hour to come (despite the restaurant being a few minutes away), the food was really good.

      "I'm by not means an expert on Philly cheesesteaks and unfortunately, have not eaten at the most popular Philly establishment. With that being said, the cheesesteak was stupendous.  It had a right mix of cheesiness and meatiness and was not too salty or too wet.  The bread was soft on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside.  My mouth is watering as I am reminded of my cheesesteak at Pete's and look forward to visiting Philly in a few weeks.\n",

I got the Pete's Special Cheesteak and cheese fries.  The steak was good chopped, with peppers, onions, mushroom and I think provolone on top, and pepperoni? .  toasted.  Amoroso roll was crunchy.   Huge sammich.  meat falling off.  All very very good.   Crinkle cut fries with wiz all over them.  Yum Yummy.  Very fast service.  I will be back for more next time.

Opened the bag, the order was right and all there. The food was pretty decent. However, this place seems to cut a lot of little things out. There was no ketchup packets included with the order, the portions were small (the fries that came with the burger special were especially skimpy) and the burgers, while decently size, has no lettuce, tomatoes, etc.\n",

The BLT suprised me because they had made it a triple decker and it was like food art when I opened it. The devil crabs (crab cake like item) were at the perfect crisp and everything inside was spiced just right with a nice texture, not like some of the other fried cakes I've had around here in south west philly. The meatballs in the spaghetti were good as well but my only gripe is the spaghetti needed more sauce, like, a lot more sauce.\n",

All the toppings and cheese were only on half the pizza, probably because the driver didn't lay it flat in the car. We also ordered mozzarella sticks which tasted like they came from a frozen box. It was cheap and easy, but not the best food.\n",

I can tell you one thing, I will not order a sandwich from this place! No way! Looked good though but I'm not reviewing how it tastes because I didn't order.
